# Competitive-Programming-Practice

- LeetCode target: 2167 / 2200
- CodeForces target: 1489 / 1600
- AtCoder target: 705 / 1400

### Notes

- some notes for different strategies that are not really alogrithms but happen so often and are hard to master (for me)
    - "ad-hoc": generic term for all of the following 
    - "conclusion" (结论): by some observation, the question can be easily reduced to some base case solutions (typically the solution is either 1 or 2 based on the input)
    - "divide and conquer" (分类讨论): not binary search, but the strategy of splitting question into different conditions and solve it under these conditions
    - "transfer" (转换): need to manually establish some style of strategy to transfer the question to a simpler case
    - "constructive algorithm" (构造): this is hard to summarize, need more practice
    - etc.
- some notes for (actual) algorithms that are hard to master
    - math
    - greedy
    - dp
    - graph
    - etc.

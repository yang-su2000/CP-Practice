# Competitive-Programming-Practice

- LeetCode target: 2075 / 2200
- CodeForces target: 1479 / 1600
- AtCoder target: 597 / 1400

### Notes

- some notes for different strategies that are not really alogrithms but happen so often and are hard to master (for me)
    - "ad-hoc": i hate this term, it means nothing, "ad-hoc" should really be some combination of the following strategies
    - "construction": similar to "ad-hoc"
    - "divide and conquer": not binary search, but the strategy of splitting question into different conditions and solve it under these conditions
    - etc.
- some notes for (actual) algorithms that are hard to master
    - math
    - greedy
    - dp
    - graph
    - etc.

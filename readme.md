# Competitive-Programming-Practice

- LeetCode target: 2221 / 2200 [achieved]
- CodeForces target: 1489 / 1600
- AtCoder target: 705 / 1400

### Notes

- "ad-hoc" (not really algorithm but tricky) algorithms
    - "conclusion" (结论): by some observation, the question can be easily reduced to some base case solutions (typically the solution is either 1 or 2 based on the input)
    - "divide and conquer" (分类讨论): not binary search, but the strategy of splitting question into different conditions and solve it under these conditions
    - "transfer" (转换): need to manually establish some style of strategy to transfer the question to a simpler case
    - "constructive algorithm" (构造): this is hard to summarize, need more practice
    - "maintain" (维护): need to preprocess some array and then modify it as we loop through something
    - etc.
- (actual) algorithms
    - math
    - greedy
    - tree: binary-index tree (BIT, or Fenwick Tree), segment tree, MST
    - dp: multidim-dp (memo, state-compression), bit-dp, tree-dp, DAG-dp
    - graph
    - etc.
